## Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)

An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code. The most famous ORM's for Python are [SQLAlquemy ORM](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy), [Peewee ORM](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) (["simpler, smaller and more hackable"](https://charlesleifer.com/blog/peewee-a-lightweight-python-orm---original-post/) than SQLAlquemy) and (Django's ORM)[https://github.com/django/django] (if you use Django).
